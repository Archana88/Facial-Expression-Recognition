# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Facial Expression Recognition using Softmax Regression and ANN

In our project, we are using two algorithms to detect facial expressions - Softmax Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Networks and then we are comparing them.

Data Source: We got our dataset from Kaggle.com for “Challenges in Representation Learning:
Facial Expression Recognition Challenge”. It consist of a database of 48x48 grayscale images with human faces in the center.

We are detecting 7 common expressions from the human face (7-class classification problem):
1. 0=Angry,
2. 1=Disgust,
3. 2=Fear,
4. 3=Happy,
5. 4=Sad,
6. 5=Surprise,
7. 6=Neutral
